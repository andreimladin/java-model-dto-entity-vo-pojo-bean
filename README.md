# Model-related terminologies: Model vs DTO vs Entity vs Value Object vs Pojo vs Bean

The goal of this repository is to make clear the meaning of a few terminologies that created a lot of confusion in the development communitity. 
I would like to mention that this clarification will be made from a Java developer's perspective.

## Model

## DTO
Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a pattern

## Entity

## Value Object

## Pojo

Pojo stands for Plain Old Java Object. 
A normal Java object, not bound by any restriction other than those forced by the Java Language Specification. They were introduced in EJB 3.0 by Sun Microsystems.

Properties of a POJO:
* All instance variables should be private
* All access-methods should be public
* Should not have any behaviour
* Should not extend any class or implement an interface
* Should not use any annotation (@Entity)

## Bean
